# Animated Loading Screen â€“ "LOADING" Effect

This project is a creative animated loading screen that spells out the word **"LOADING"** using a sequence of animated letters. Built entirely with HTML and CSS, it provides a smooth visual experience for loading pages or transitions.

## Features

- Animated letter-by-letter movement across the screen
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out transitions
- 180-degree rotation effect
- Cross-browser support using prefixed keyframes
- Minimal and fully responsive design

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Animations, Keyframes, Transforms)

## How It Works

Each character of the word **"LOADING"** is placed in its own `<div>` inside a parent container with `id="load"`. A CSS animation moves each letter:
- From left to right across the screen
- With increasing delay per letter for a wave effect
- Rotating 180 degrees
- Fading in at the center and fading out at the end

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Watch the animated "LOADING" text in action.

## Notes

- This is a front-end only loading animation for visual purposes.
- No JavaScript is required.
